					<p> We are a biotech company that develops immunotherapies based on the modulation of galectins for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory conditions, supported by the scientific findings of the research group led by <a href="#our-team">Dr. Gabriel Rabinovich.</a></p>
					<p>
						Throughout almost 30 years, our research group has built a deep knowledge about the central role of galectins and their glycosylated ligands in the immune system's homeostasis contributing to the identification of "Glycocheckpoints" as a new paradigm in immunotherapy. Our findings have been supported by over 320 scientific articles published in leading journals worldwide, resulting in multiple groundbreaking invention patents.

					<span>Karina Mariño obtained her master's and PhD in Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires.</span> She specialized in glycobiology during her postdoctoral position at the Division of Biological Chemistry and Drug Discovery, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee in Scotland, and in glycoanalytics at the National Institute for Bioprocessing, Research and Training in Dublin, Ireland. In 2012, she returned to Argentina to work as a researcher at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine (IBYME) and as a director of the Molecular and Functional Glycomics Laboratory, which is part of the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET). Since 2021, she has been the national representative of the International Glycoconjugate Organization. Her research focuses on identifying new glycobiological circuits in intestinal diseases using a translational, integrative, and multidisciplinary approach. She has received several awards, including the Udaondo Award in 2019 from the National Academy of Medicine (Argentina) for her work in glycoimmunology of intestinal inflammation, and the Florencio Fiorini Foundation Biennial Award on Cancer Research in 2021 for her research on colorectal cancer. Lastly, due to her proficiency in glycobiology and glycoanalytics, she has become a consultant and provided services to local and regional biotechnology companies.
